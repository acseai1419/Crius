Numerical Analysis
=====================================================================================

In Epilysis_3D one can find different settings;

for saving vtk files,

changing the solver parameters and 

giving full elastic moduli tensors instead of Young modulus and Poisson ratio (the last one has not been tested as it was not needed in the current project but was put as a future functinality).

By default it is not saving .vtk files, 

uses the deafault GMRES parameters and 

accepts Young moduli and Poisson ratios. 

To change settings one needs to do it from inside the epilysis_3D module
