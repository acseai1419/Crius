### 3-D CT Scans

In this directory one can find the work for generating the .msh files of 3-D CT scans to be imported in the numerical analysis.
The meshes are generated after reading a pack of 2-D images taken from a two phase material.

Two methods were developed:

1.  Generating the Voluemtric Mesh using Gmsh suftware from the Surface Meshes (.stl) generated using Pygalmesh library.
2.  Generating the Volumetric Mesh using Gmsh software by generating geometric files in FreeCad (.brep)
